# README

Welcome to RANT. Rant is a simple social media platform, allowing users to post their thoughts (RANTs and RAVES) anonymously. 

* Ruby version
    -RANT utilizes Ruby version 2.6.1

* Configuration
    -Frontend and Backend directories have one additional subdirectory needed to initialize both servers. 
        -frontend: Rant-Project/frontend/rant
        -backend: Rant-Project/backend/Rant

    -Two terminals are necessary to operate this program. Once in the frontend/rant directory, run 'npm install' and 'npm start' to initialize the frontend. In your second terminal, navigate to backend/Rant, run 'bulndle install', and 'rails s -p 3001' (or whichever alternate local host server you choose - the front end will automatically run on :3000).
